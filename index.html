        <p>To a lot of gearheads, JDM cars are considered a guilty pleasure.</br>
            It doesn't matter if they're into roaring V8s or prefer German precision engineering,</br>
            very few car enthusiasts can resist the sound of a tuned K-series screaming as VTEC kicks in,</br>
            or the throaty rumble of a well-tuned WRX.</p>

          <p><br><br><br><br>If you're a fan of Japanese sports cars, looking to buy <br>or import one, 
            or just want to learn more about JDM cars, <br>we've updated this list 
            with more accurate and recent information.</p>

          <h2>JDM, of course, refers to the Japanese Domestic Market</h2>
          <p><br><br>
            basically, cars that are only sold in Japan. <br>
            However, with time, it's been watered down to include cars that are made in Japan <br>
            exported to other countries.</p>

          <h2>Part 2</h2>
          <p><br><br><br><br>Some "JDM cars," were never available in the United States, <br>
            others have been slightly modified to make them legal for importation—and where this is the case, <br>
            we will explain the differences.</p>

          <h2>Japanese carmakers have given us...</h2>
          <p>...some of the greatest cars ever, and any true car enthusiast
            remembers how the Nissan Skyline R32 won the Australian Bathurst 1000 in both 1991 and 1992,
            upsetting the status quo and forcing rule changes 
            that banned "Godzilla" from competing in the race.</p>

            <p>The R34 GT-R is a car that is universally loved by all. We have never heard of one single person that disliked it. Like the Supra, it came with a twin-turbo, 3.0-liter engine, the RB26DETT. Power output was down, claimed by Nissan to be 276 horses, but that has since proven to be a gross underestimation.</p>

            <p>Released in 1994, Toyota made the Mark IV lighter and more powerful than its predecessor. It came with the now-legendary 2JZ engine with twin sequential turbochargers and with a stock short block and a head swap, could be tuned to 1,000 horsepower on otherwise stock internals.</p>

              <p>One of the greatest drifting cars is currently banned for sale in the USA due to the 25-year import rule and there is a small chance it may never be allowed on these shores. Of course, we are talking about the Nissan S15 which is a 250-hp, four-cylinder, rear-wheel-drive oversteer factory.</p>

              <p>When Honda released the EK9 Civic, it wasn’t much to look at. It was naturally aspirated. But underneath the dreary exterior laid a limited-slip diff, dual cams with profiles that allowed for full-on track lunacy, a front strut brace, and Recaro bucket seats. The EK9 was the first Civic to wear the Type R badge, and despite being the recipient of a thousand "VTEC kicked in" memes, it wore it with pride.</p>

              <p>The original Impreza WRX was versatile, featured an all-wheel-drive system, a 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, and has the rally championships to back up its smack talk. The initial WRX, and the even-better STI, weren’t available in the USA until more than a decade after its release. It took a lot of campaigning for Subaru to make inroads into the US domestic market, first making the STI available to US fans in 2004.</p>

              <p>The FD was the RX-7's third generation, and while it's arguably the best-looking generation, it's also the most unreliable. However, lots of gearheads were more than willing to overlook its shortcomings in exchange for the intense sensory overload that occurred when it was driven. The RX-7 is unique thanks to its twin-turbo 13B Wankel rotary engine which makes a heavenly sound that may or may not induce nightmares in muscle car lovers.</p>
